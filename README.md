## TODOs:

- Add more test cases for Tabs
- Create a form component that'll take care of inputs and submition

## Assumptions

- A stop means any node other than source and target. So if A and G are source and target. Then in AEG, E is a stop node.
- For now, adding a link that already exists, will override the cost.
- By default, the max number of stops in input is 15
